# 3d-ball-mlagents
This is a sample program using Unity ML Agents that trains a series of agents to balance balls on their head without letting it drop. Using a pre-existing NN Model, I trained the boxes for several iterations to become effective at not dropping balls. 

Loading/Setting up after cloning repo and opening in Unity:  
Navigate to Assets/Ml-Agents/Examples/3DBall/Scenes and select 3DBall scene (or any scene)
Default Tensor Flow model should be newly trained "3DBall01 (NN Model); can check this by clicking on Agent under any of the 3DBall(#) and viewing above model in inspector.
